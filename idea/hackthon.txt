Sky’s the Limit - Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon
Reimagine the future. Make it happen. With code.

Welcome to Sky’s the Limit - Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon
Cloud9 is bringing its competitive spirit from the arena to the dev world—with a global hackathon built to ignite creativity, sharpen skills, and bring bold ideas to life. As one of the most storied organizations in esports, Cloud9 is known for championship rosters, fierce innovation, and a community that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible. Whether you’re a gamer, a builder, or a curious creator, this is your chance to level up alongside a team that never stops evolving.

In this hackathon, entrants will build or update a working application using the tools of their choice—plus optional support from JetBrains’ AI Coding Agent, Junie. Junie can help accelerate your workflow and unlock new ways to create, but the real spotlight is on you and the ideas you bring to the table.

With exclusive resources like official esports data for League of Legends and VALORANT provided by GRID, expert guidance, and a prize pool that rewards innovation, this is your arena. Pick a category, lock in, and show Cloud9 what you can build.

Requirements
What to Build

Entrants must build or update a working application that uses JetBrains IDEs and Junie and submit it into one of the following categories:

Category 1 - A comprehensive Assistant Coach powered by Data Science and AI: that merges micro-level player analytics with macro-level strategic review. Inspired by Moneyball (Jonah Hill’s Peter Brand), this near-real-time application analyzes historical match data to provide a holistic and actionable review. The platform crunches the numbers to identify recurring individual mistakes and connects them directly to their impact on team-wide macro strategy, generating targeted insights for coaches and players.

Category 2 - Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report would highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VAL), or recently played comps (for LoL & VAL).

Category 3 - AI Drafting Assistant/Drafting Predictor (LoL): Develop a tool that analyzes historical GRID data (team compositions, player champion/agent pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against specific opponents in real-time during the pick/ban phase.

Category 4 - Event Game: Develop a mini-game that can be played by fans at a LCS or VCT Event Booth or Finals Activation. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.


What to Submit

RULES
New & Existing: Projects must be either newly created by the Entrant or, if the Entrant’s Project existed prior to the Hackathon Submission Period, must have significantly updated after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period. Entrants should explain how their Project was significantly updated during the Submission Period.

Third Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool.

 Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.

Provide a URL to your code repository for judging and testing. The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional. The repository must be public and open source by including an open source license file. This license should be detectable and visible at the top of the repository page (in the About section).  

Include which category you are submitting to. 

Include a text description that should explain the features and functionality of your Project.

Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission:

should be less than three (3) minutes. Judges are not required to watch beyond three minutes 

should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built

must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and

must not include third party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.


Testing 

Access must be provided to an Entrant’s working Project for judging and testing by providing a link to a website, functioning demo, or a test build. If Entrant’s website is private, Entrant must include login credentials in its testing instructions. The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Judges are not required to test the Project and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission.

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.

This project is apply for:
Category 4: Event Mini-Game
What to Build
You are a Game Developer tasked by Cloud9 and JetBrains to create a fun, engaging, and fast-paced mini-game for fans. Your game will be the main attraction at a booth during a major LCS or VCT event.

Your game needs to be easy to pick up, fun to play, and capture the excitement of esports! It must be something a fan can play in just a few minutes while waiting in line or visiting the booth. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.

Game Requirements
Your game could perform the following core functions or meet these design goals.

Be Fast & Engaging: A single play session should be quick, ideally under 3 minutes. The goal is "high replayability."

Be Intuitive & Accessible: Use simple controls (e.g., mouse-only, arrow keys, single-button) that anyone can understand instantly with no tutorial.

Be Thematic: The game could be thematically related to the Cloud9 brand or the JetBrains brand. It could also be based around the esports titles of League of Legends or VALORANT; however, this is not a requirement.

How can you take it to the next level?

Implement a Live Leaderboard: Create a dynamic "high score" list that can be displayed on a screen at the event booth, driving competition among fans.

You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable and exciting, leveraging your creative ideas to bring it to life.

Demonstration Prompts & Submission
Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must clearly demonstrate a full, playable gameplay loop. The following outputs are examples only, intended to illustrate the type of game you could create. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!

Main Prompt: Gameplay Showcase
Task: "Your video submission must clearly demonstrate a full gameplay loop. Show a user starting the game, playing it, and reaching a 'Game Over' or 'Score' screen."

Example (VALORANT Theme): "Junie's Site Retake"

Concept: A 2D, mouse-only game. You control the JetBrains "Junie" mascot. Enemy utility (e.g., Viper Orb, Killjoy grenade, Cypher tripwire) appears on a site. You must click to "debug" (remove) the enemy utility while avoiding clicking on friendly C9 player abilities. Score is based on speed and accuracy.



Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

Platforms: A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements.
